            <p>The base or simple types of Free Pascal are the Delphi types.</p>
            <p>A list of some pre-defined integer types is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integer</li>
                <li>Word</li>
                <li>Byte</li>
                <li>Char</li>
                <li>Boolean</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All decimal constants which do no fit within the -2147483648..2147483647 range are silently and
automatically parsed as 64-bit integer constants as of version 1.9.0. Earlier versions would convert it
to a real-typed constant.</p>
            <p>In Free Pascal, boolean expressions are by default always evaluated in such a way that when the
result is known, the rest of the expression will no longer be evaluated: this is called short-cut boolean
evaluation.</p>
            <p>Enumeration types are supported in Free Pascal. On top of the Turbo Pascal implementation, Free
Pascal allows also a C-style extension of the enumeration type, where a value is assigned to a particular element of the enumeration list.</p>            
            <code>
    Type
      EnumType = (one, two, three, forty := 40, thirty := 30);
            </code>            
            <code>
    Type
    {$PACKENUM 4}
      LargeEnum = ( BigOne, BigTwo, BigThree );
    {$PACKENUM 1}
      SmallEnum = ( one, two, three );
    Var S : SmallEnum;
      L : LargeEnum;
    begin
      WriteLn (’Small enum : ’,SizeOf(S));
      WriteLn (’Large enum : ’,SizeOf(L));
    end.
            </code>                
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Character_types">
            <header>Character types</header>
            <p>Free Pascal supports the type <code>Char</code>. A <code>Char</code> is exactly 1 byte in size, and contains one ASCII
character.</p>
            <p>A character constant can be specified by enclosing the character in single quotes, as follows : ’a’ or
’A’ are both character constants.</p>
            <p>A character can also be specified by its character value (commonly an ASCII code), by preceding the
ordinal value with the number symbol (#). For example specifying <code>#65</code> would be the same as ’<code>A</code>’.</p>
            <p>Also, the caret character (<code>^</code>) can be used in combination with a letter to specify a character with
ASCII value less than 27. Thus <code>^G</code> equals <code>#7</code> - G is the seventh letter in the alphabet. The compiler
is rather sloppy about the characters it allows after the caret, but in general one should assume only
letters.</p>
            <p>When the single quote character must be represented, it should be typed two times successively, thus
’’’’ represents the single quote character.</p>
            <p>To distinguish <code>Char</code> from <code>WideChar</code>, the system unit also defines the <code>AnsiChar</code> type, which is
the same as the char type. In future versions of FPC, the <code>Char</code> type may become an alias for either
<code>WideChar</code> or <code>AnsiChar</code>.</p>                
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Structured_types">
            <header>Structured types</header>
            <p>When a structured type is declared, no assumptions should be made about the internal position of the
elements in the type. The compiler will lay out the elements of the structure in memory as it thinks
will be most suitable. That is, the order of the elements will be kept, but the location of the elements
are not guaranteed, and is partially governed by the <code>$PACKRECORDS</code> directive</p>
            <p>When the range of the array is included in the array definition, it is called a static array. Trying to
access an element with an index that is outside the declared range will generate a run-time error (if
range checking is on). The following is an example of a valid array declaration:</p>
            <code>
    Type
      RealArray = Array [1..100] of Real;</code>
            <p>Free Pascal supports fixed records and records with variant parts. The following are valid record type declarations:</p>
            <code>
    Type
      Point = Record
              X,Y,Z : Real;
              end;
    RPoint = Record
            Case Boolean of
            False : (X,Y,Z : Real);
            True : (R,theta,phi : Real);
            end;
    BetterRPoint = Record
            Case UsePolar : Boolean of
            False : (X,Y,Z : Real);
            True : (R,theta,phi : Real);
            end;
            </code>                
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Pointers">
            <header>Pointers</header>
            <p>Free Pascal supports the use of pointers. A variable of the pointer type contains an address in memory,
where the data of another variable may be stored.</p>
            <p>Pointers are typed, which means that they point to a particular kind of data. The type of this data must be known at compile time.</p>
            <p>Dereferencing the pointer (denoted by adding <code>ˆ</code> after the variable name) behaves then like a variable. This variable has the type declared in the pointer declaration, and the variable is stored in the address that is pointed to by the pointer variable. Consider the following example:</p>
            <code>
    Program pointers;
    type            
      Buffer = String[255];
      BufPtr = ^Buffer;
    Var B : Buffer;
        BP : BufPtr;
        PP : Pointer;
    etc..
            </code>                
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Forward_type_declarations">
            <header>Forward type declarations</header>
            <p>Programs often need to maintain a linked list of records. Each record then contains a pointer to the
next record (and possibly to the previous record as well). For type safety, it is best to define this
pointer as a typed pointer, so the next record can be allocated on the heap using the <code>New</code> call.</p>             
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Procedural_types">
            <header>Procedural types</header>
            <p>Free Pascal has support for procedural types, although it differs a little from the Turbo Pascal or Delphi implementation of them. The type declaration remains the same.</p>                
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Managed_types">
            <header>Managed types</header>
            <p>By default, pascal types are unmanaged. That means that variables must be explicitly initialized,
finalized, memory allocated and so on. However, in Object Pascal, several types are managed, which
means that the compiler initializes and finalizes variables of this type: this is necessary, for instance
for reference counted data types.</p>
            <p>The following types are managed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AnsiString They are initialized to <code>Nil</code>.</li>
                <li>UnicodeString They are initialized to <code>Nil</code>.</li>
                <li>WideString They are initialized to <code>Nil</code>.</li>
                <li>Interface They are initialized to <code>Nil</code>.</li>
                <li>Dynamic arrays They are initialized to <code>Nil</code>.</li>            
            </ul>
